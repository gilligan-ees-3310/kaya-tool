Description: A Shiny-based explorer for Kaya identity. Loads data from the kayadata package and
  provides an interactive shiny app for exploring the data: choose a country or region and 
  examine trends in the Kaya variables (population, gross domestic product, primary energy 
  consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions), compare historical trends to the implied trends 
  necessary to hit decarbonization policy targets (e.g., 70% reduction of emissions by 2050). 
  Also allows the user to explore the fuel mix that different countries and regions use to 
  supply their energy needs.
