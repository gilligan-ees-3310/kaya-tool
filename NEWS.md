# kayatool 0.2.1

Moved github repository to https://github.com/gilligan-ees-3310/kayatool

# kayatool 0.2.0

* Rewrite data loading to work with BP Statistical Review of World Energy
  and World Bank population and economic data because that is more reliably
  up to date than the other sources I had used, and they cover more
  countries.
  
    The down side is that there aren't top-down predictions for most of the
    countries.

* Remove top-down tab.

#  kayatool 0.1.0

* Initial release
